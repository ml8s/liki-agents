# Security Policy

`liki-agents` is an internal runtime and must not be exposed directly to the
public internet.

Required controls:

- Internal bearer token between the gateway and `liki-agents` outside local
  development.
- The same internal token for protocol calls and `/metrics`.
- Verified user context supplied by the gateway for AG-UI.
- The browser identity header is adopted on AG-UI only; A2A machine callers
  sharing the internal token cannot spoof a user identity.
- Internet-facing request rate limiting is owned by the gateway; the runtime's
  internal per-source limiter only resists token brute force.
- Bounded per-source throttling of invalid bearer or identity attempts.
- Mandatory deployment digest pinning outside development.
- HTTPS-only LLM endpoints outside development and no credentials embedded in
  configured URLs.
- Explicit per-Agent MCP tool allowlists.
- No secrets, prompts, raw model output, or tool payloads in logs.
- Least-privilege, non-root deployment.
