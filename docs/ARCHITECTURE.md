# Architecture

## System boundary

`liki-agents` is a generic multi-agent runtime. `liki-web` owns users,
authentication, products, payments, entitlements, quota, and durable product
conversations. The Liki skill/project owns prompts, skills, domain policy, and
tool semantics. External MCP servers expose deterministic and judgment tools.

```text
Server / machine client
  ↓ A2A JSON-RPC
┌────────────┐   MCP Streamable HTTP
│ liki-agents │──────────────────────→ MCP tools (Engine, Counsel, ...)
└────────────┘
  ↑ AG-UI SSE
liki-web gateway
```

There is one execution path and no private `/v1` application API.

## AgentDeployment

The runtime starts from an external `AgentDeployment` artifact. The artifact is
an ADK Agent tree: it may contain one or more Agent definitions, and its unique
incoming-edge-free Agent is the entrypoint. Each Agent definition supplies:

- instruction text file;
- optional JSON Schema for structured output;
- paired JSON Pointer selecting the user-facing text when structured output is
  declared;
- logical MCP server declarations with endpoint/token environment references;
- server-scoped MCP tool allowlists;
- standard ADK delegation mode and `sub_agents`;
- version.

Prompt, output schema, and tool semantics are not built into Go.
Instructions are installed through ADK's `InstructionProvider` path because
AgentDeployment prompts are immutable text artifacts and may contain literal
JSON/code braces. ADK must not interpret those braces as session-state
placeholders.
The manifest is validated against the canonical JSON Schema 2020-12 contract
before graph and file semantics are evaluated.
The deployment digest covers the manifest plus resolved instruction and output
schema artifacts and the ADK graph semantics; it is not a hash of the manifest
alone. Production may pin that complete digest with
`LIKI_AGENTS_DEPLOYMENT_DIGEST`; startup fails closed when the loaded artifact
does not match.

## Principles

1. A2A and AG-UI are standard protocol adapters over one shared runtime.
2. Google ADK Go v2 owns the model/tool execution graph.
3. MCP is the only boundary to external deterministic tools.
4. Every tool call is constrained by the Agent's explicit allowlist.
5. Audit is append-only execution evidence.
6. `internal/domain` remains free of transport, provider, adapter, and storage
   imports.
7. Standard libraries and framework APIs are preferred over local equivalents.

## Dependencies and modules

```text
cmd/liki-agents
  → internal/transport
  → internal/protocol/a2a
  → internal/protocol/agui
  → internal/agent
  → MCP servers / model provider

internal/audit/sqlite
  → internal/audit
  → internal/domain

internal/observability/prometheus
  → observability interfaces
```

Protocol adapters never import each other. Database technology is confined to
`internal/audit/sqlite`.

## Runtime execution

A protocol request is mapped to a generic `RunRequest`. History and opaque
protocol context may be supplied by the caller; the runtime does not store
product conversation state.

Run, thread, and user identifiers are required. A RunID cannot start while it
is active, and an ADK session is run-scoped: terminal execution removes the
working session so the runtime does not retain prompts, model events, or tool
responses in memory.
Both protocol adapters enforce the configured total run deadline, and the
runtime bounds concurrent model/MCP executions with
`LIKI_MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS`.

The entrypoint `AgentDefinition` supplies instruction, an optional output
schema, and the tool allowlist. Plain text is the default. When structured
output is declared, the runtime uses ADK's OpenAI-compatible model integration
and selects either native JSON schema or provider-safe JSON object mode.

MCP tools are consumed through MCP Streamable HTTP and filtered by the
server-scoped AgentDefinition allowlist. Tool calls and responses become
protocol facts and execution evidence; model assertions do not create tool
provenance.
ADK's built-in `transfer_to_agent` call is not an MCP tool. It remains visible
on AG-UI as a tool event and is audited through Agent delegation lifecycle
events rather than MCP tool provenance.

Raw structured model output is not emitted to protocol observers. Partial
events are suppressed. A structured Agent returns validated generic JSON plus
the user-facing text selected by its configured JSON Pointer; a plain-text
Agent returns final model text directly. In a delegated plain-text tree, the
last terminal expert model response is the root user-facing answer. Structured
output state keys are
Agent-scoped, so delegated structured Agents cannot overwrite the entrypoint
result.

## Protocols

Protocol choices are governed by [`STANDARDS.md`](STANDARDS.md); a private wire
protocol must not replace a reviewed standard.

A2A uses the official A2A Go SDK JSON-RPC binding and ADK A2A executor.
The runtime uses the executor's standard ContextID-to-ADK-session mapping. No
private A2A extension, RPC method, or state machine is advertised.

MCP endpoint bindings are deployment-owned complete URLs. A gateway may expose
service prefixes such as `/engine` and `/counsel`; the MCP service owns its
standard `/mcp` and `/mcp/{domain}` routes. The runtime consumes the configured
URL verbatim through the official MCP SDK and does not translate paths.

Google ADK is the internal execution runtime, not the public control plane. The
ADK Launcher/REST API is intentionally not exposed. External clients use only
the standard protocol surfaces above; MCP readiness is exposed through
`/readyz`.

AG-UI decodes the official `RunAgentInput` and emits official SSE events. The
supported profile is text chat; unsupported capabilities are rejected rather
than silently ignored.
Official clients may send an absent, null, or empty `state` value; the stateless
runtime ignores it. Non-empty client state is rejected with a stable error code.

Event mapping:

| Runtime fact | AG-UI event |
|---|---|
| accepted run | `RUN_STARTED` |
| sub-agent start | `SUBAGENT_STARTED` |
| sub-agent end | `SUBAGENT_FINISHED` |
| sub-agent failure | `SUBAGENT_ERROR` |
| MCP tool call | `TOOL_CALL_START` / `TOOL_CALL_ARGS` with sub-agent attribution |
| MCP tool response | `TOOL_CALL_RESULT` / `TOOL_CALL_END` with sub-agent attribution |
| final answer | `TEXT_MESSAGE_START` / `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` / `TEXT_MESSAGE_END` |
| success | `RUN_FINISHED` |
| failure | `RUN_ERROR` |

`RUN_FINISHED` contains the AgentDefinition reference, validated output when
structured output is declared, and the authoritative user-facing `answer` text
for the Liki product profile. A run never emits `RUN_ERROR` after
`RUN_FINISHED`.

The A2A Agent Card uses curated `AgentDefinition` descriptions, mode, tool
allowlist tags, and deployment provenance. It never includes instructions,
prompts, raw model output, or tool payloads.

## Operations

Version and readiness are public standard transport endpoints. Metrics use the
same bearer-token boundary as protocol calls whenever an internal token is
configured. All POST endpoints enforce a 2 MB body limit.

Bearer-token failures and missing verified identities are counted in a bounded
fixed window per TCP socket source. Untrusted forwarding headers never change
the source. A source that exceeds ten failures in one minute receives HTTP 429
and the stable `rate_limited` code.

Readiness checks SQLite and every declared MCP dependency through the official
MCP discovery RPC. It requires the configured MCP revision, server identity,
tool capability, and every allowlisted tool.
During process drain, readiness reports `draining` before the standard HTTP
server shutdown deadline waits for active protocol requests.

Prometheus exposes protocol request count and duration, active streams, LLM
calls and tokens, tool calls and duration, and dependency readiness. Structured
logging uses `log/slog` with stable event names. Logs do not contain user prompts,
raw model output, or tool payloads.

Audit events are append-only SQLite records. They contain execution metadata,
protocol, trace correlation, agent and deployment digests, versions, status,
duration, and error codes—not conversation or domain payloads.

Before accepting traffic, the single-process runtime transactionally finds
started run, LLM, tool, and delegation events without terminal evidence and
appends synthetic failures coded `runtime_interrupted`. Recovery uses stable
lifecycle IDs, preserves original provenance, is idempotent, and never updates
or deletes history. Execution is still not resumed after a crash; clients start
a new run. The `multi` topology remains fail-closed until audit ownership is
transactional across replicas.

## Observability and audit implementation

The system separates telemetry from durable evidence:

- Prometheus exports aggregate metrics.
- `log/slog` emits structured operational logs.
- OpenTelemetry emits distributed traces over the standard OTLP protocol.
- SQLite stores immutable audit events.

The runtime emits an `agent.run` span and propagates W3C trace context. Trace
IDs and span IDs are also stored on audit events so a compliance record can be
correlated with its distributed trace without duplicating payloads.

OpenTelemetry is enabled only when a standard OTLP endpoint is present:

```text
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=http://otel-collector:4318/v1/traces
```

Sampling follows standard `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER` and
`OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG` variables.

Stable error codes live in `internal/domain/error_codes.go`.
