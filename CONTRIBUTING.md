# Contributing

Thanks for improving `liki-agents`.

## Development

1. Install Go 1.26+, Node.js 22+, Docker, and golangci-lint 2.x.
2. Run `npm ci`.
3. Start from a focused, small change.
4. Run the full gate before review:

```bash
make gate
make build
```

`make gate` runs documentation checks, `gofmt` verification, `golangci-lint`,
`go vet`, artifact validation, and race-enabled Go tests. It does not call a
model provider or require Engine MCP.

## Design rules

- Keep the runtime domain-neutral.
- Put Agent behavior in external deployment artifacts.
- Add dependencies only when they replace meaningful complexity.
- Use official protocol SDKs and standard library APIs first.
- Keep `internal/domain` free of transport, provider, and storage imports.
- Allowlist every MCP tool explicitly.
- Never log secrets, prompts, raw model output, or tool payloads.

## Documentation

Update `README.md` only when installation, usage, behavior, or the public
surface changes. Keep architecture invariants in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and
stable runtime domain rules in `docs/DOMAIN.md`.
